  ## Description
  This is a weather forecast that allows the user to enter a city and it will display a five day forecast that includes weather conditions. This application was developed using the OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve its data. We also use localstorage to store our recent search history. We must first start this project by navigating to the OpenWeather url and request an API key, and from there we begin developing.
